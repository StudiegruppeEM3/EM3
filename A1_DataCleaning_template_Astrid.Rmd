# Assignment 1, Language development in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - Brushing up your code skills

Reference to the study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396129

Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often related to language impairment, and language impairment strongly affects the patients ability to function socially (maintaining a social network, thriving at work, etc.). It is therefore crucial to understand how language abilities develop in children with ASD, and which factors affect them (to figure out e.g. how a child will develop in the future and whether there is a need for language therapy).
However, language impairment is always quantified by relying on the parent, teacher or clinician subjective judgment of the child, and measured very sparcely (e.g. at 3 years of age and again at 6). 

In this study the researchers videotaped circa 30 kids with ASD and circa 30 comparison kids (matched by linguistic performance at visit 1) for ca. 30 minutes of naturalistic interactions with a parent. They repeated the data collection 6 times per kid, with 4 months between each visit. Then the researchers transcribed the data and counted: 
i) the amount of words that each kid uses in each video. Same for the parent.
ii) the amount of unique words that each kid uses in each video. Same for the parent.
iii) the amount of morphemes per utterance (Mean Length of Utterance) displayed by each child in each video. Same for the parent. 

Different researchers involved in the project provide you with different datasets: 
1) demographic and clinical data about the children (recorded by a clinical psychologist)
2) length of utterance data (calculated by a linguist)
3) amount of unique and total words used (calculated by a jack-of-all-trade, let's call him RF)

## 2. Data cleaning

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,janitor, stringr)
```

```{r}
#loading the three data sets, which contain different data we need for the analysis. 

# Demographic data for the participants
demo_train <- read.csv("demo_train.csv")
#Length of utterance data
LU_train <- read.csv("LU_train.csv")
#Word data
token_train <- read.csv("token_train.csv")
```

### 2.a

Some columns have different names in the three datasets. We'll fix this. 

```{r}
#renaming columns that are not the same in all three datasets
demo_train = demo_train %>% 
  rename("SUBJ" = "Child.ID")%>% 
  rename("VISIT" = "Visit")
```

### 2.b

Some datapoints are reported differently. We also fix this.
I.e. the visit number is reported either as "Visit1" or just "1"

```{r}
#removing all letters (the word "visit) from LU and token train's visit column, so that all datasets only contain numbers.
LU_train$VISIT <- str_extract(LU_train$VISIT,"\\d")    
token_train$VISIT <- str_extract(token_train$VISIT,"\\d")

```

### 2.c

Similarly, periods are used differently in the datasets.


```{r}
#removing all periods in the ID columns

LU_train$SUBJ <- str_replace_all(LU_train$SUBJ,"[.]","")   
token_train$SUBJ <- str_replace_all(token_train$SUBJ,"[.]","")   
demo_train$SUBJ <- str_replace_all(demo_train$SUBJ,"[.]","")  

```

### 2.d

Next, we make a subset, containing only the relevant columns we will later need for our analysis. 

```{r}

demo_train <-  select(demo_train, SUBJ, VISIT, Diagnosis, Ethnicity, Gender, Age, ADOS, MullenRaw, ExpressiveLangRaw, Socialization) 

LU_train <- select(LU_train, SUBJ, VISIT, MOT_MLU, CHI_MLU)

token_train <- select(token_train, VISIT, SUBJ, VISIT, types_MOT, types_CHI, tokens_MOT, tokens_CHI)

```


Most variables should make sense, here the less intuitive ones. 
* ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) indicates the severity of the autistic symptoms (the higher the score, the worse the symptoms). Ref: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005592401947
* MLU stands for mean length of utterance (usually a proxy for syntactic complexity)
* types stands for unique words (e.g. even if "doggie" is used 100 times it only counts for 1)
* tokens stands for overall amount of words (if "doggie" is used 100 times it counts for 100) 
* MullenRaw indicates non verbal IQ, as measured by Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1698-3_596)
* ExpressiveLangRaw indicates verbal IQ, as measured by MSEL
* Socialization indicates social interaction skills and social responsiveness, as measured by Vineland (https://cloudfront.ualberta.ca/-/media/ualberta/faculties-and-programs/centres-institutes/community-university-partnership/resources/tools---assessment/vinelandjune-2012.pdf)


### 2.e. Finally we merge all the data sets into just one. 


```{r}
#merging two of the datasets
df <- merge(demo_train, LU_train)
#adding the last dataset
df <- merge(df,token_train)

```


### 2f. Only using clinical measures from Visit 1

We want to look at the clinal measures from Visit 1 specifically. 


```{r}
#creating a new dataset with only the data from the first visit
df_v1 <- filter(df, VISIT == 1)

# selecting the relevant columns in this new dataframe
df_v1 <- select(df_v1, SUBJ, VISIT, ADOS, MullenRaw, ExpressiveLangRaw, Socialization)

#renaming columns to indicate it is only for visit 1
df_v1 = df_v1 %>% 
  rename("ADOS1" = "ADOS")%>% 
  rename("MullenRaw1" = "MullenRaw")%>% 
  rename("ExpressiveLangRaw1" = "ExpressiveLangRaw")%>% 
  rename("Socialization1" = "Socialization")

#adding these columns to the big dataset
df <- merge(df, df_v1, by="SUBJ")

```

### 2g. Final touches

Now we want to
* anonymize our participants (they are real children!). 
* make sure the variables have sensible values. 
* Save the data set using into a csv file. Hint: look into write.csv()

```{r}
#anonymize participants 
df$SUBJ <- as.factor(df$SUBJ)
df$SUBJ <- as.numeric(df$SUBJ)

#renaming gender and diagnos values 
df$Gender <- ifelse(df$Gender == 1, "F","M")
df$Diagnosis <- ifelse(df$Diagnosis == "A", "ASD","TD")

#saving data 

# write.csv(df, file = "df.csv")

#I've commented this line out to avoid duplicating the dataframe which was created using another person in our groups code.
```
